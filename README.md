💬 Ask me about:

- ⚙️ Go, concurrency patterns, and performance optimization.
- 🧑‍💻 Open-source Go projects.
- 🐳 Docker, dev environments, and best practices.

🔭 I’m currently focused on:

- 🌱 Deep diving into Go’s concurrency patterns and advanced packages.
- 💻 Collaborating on high-performance, open-source Go projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute—now let's see if I can debug code just as fast!
